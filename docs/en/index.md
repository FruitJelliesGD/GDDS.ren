::: danger The men Ding Menghan met in his life formed the word: 'Romantic Fantasies'

### Map introduction
#### Menghan Town
The location is like Novice Village, with a simple and cute style, relaxed and happy. This is where the most important protagonists live. The story takes place in this simple and unpretentious town.
#### Huangxin Town
Huangxin Town is famous in Overwatch Continent for hosting a large number of top professional competitions, and is the residence of a large number of top professional players. After the town became rich, it changed the decoration style of the town and turned it into a European retro town. The gorgeous Huangxin Castle was built for all professional players to live in. It is very wealthy for a small town, but the mayor seems to have some ulterior secrets.
#### King's Row City
It is always dark due to some kind of magical barrier. It is a cyberpunk-style city that seems to be prosperous but is actually in decline. The trend here is to dye the skin into various colors. The filming location of "Love and Overwatch" is located here. There are many exhibitions, lectures, and events about Overwatch here, and most Overwatch practitioners live here.
#### Rialto City
There are many rivers in the city, which is a city of rivers, flowers, fashion and art. There is a tradition of worshiping the river god every year here, but there is a terrifying truth behind this sacrificial activity...


## Love And Overwatch

#### A fan-made text adventure game based on the game background of `Overwatch`, with Ameng as the protagonist.
